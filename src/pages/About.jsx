        The Lorm alphabet is a method of tactile signing named after Hieronymus
        Lorm, who developed it in the late 19th century. Letters are spelled by
        tapping or stroking different parts of the listener's hand. The Lorm
        alphabet is mostly used in German-speaking countries, the Netherlands,
        Czech Republic, Poland and Georgia.
